Break it down for me
I don't mind at all
Sit me down by the tree
What you did last fall
I tried to pretend that I care, but I don't care at all
Don't care at all
I don't belong in this world
I don't belong in this world
I leave my songs in this world
You can read them, you can feel them
You can find out what you like

So, break it down for me
I don't mind at all
Sit me down by the tree
